# Code Diff Highlighting Test Results

## Summary of Changes Made

### 1. Updated `highlightProblematicCode` function
- Now checks `problematicEnvironment` field from API response
- Only highlights the side that has the vulnerability (`dev`, `prod`, or `both`)
- Skips highlighting for non-problematic sides

### 2. Enhanced tooltip recommendations
- Shows environment-specific context (e.g., "DEV Issue: Consider enabling SSL/TLS...")
- Only displays recommendation for the vulnerable side

### 3. Updated TypeScript interfaces
- Added `problematicValue` and `problematicEnvironment` fields to `ComparisonResult`
- Maintains backwards compatibility with existing `suggestion` field

## Expected Behavior

### Before Changes:
- Both dev and prod sides were highlighted with squiggly underlines
- Tooltips showed the same recommendation regardless of which side was problematic
- Could be confusing as to which side actually needed fixing

### After Changes:
- Only the side with the vulnerability is highlighted (based on `problematicEnvironment`)
- Tooltips show environment-specific recommendations
- Clear indication of which side needs attention

## Test Case Example

**API Response:**
```json
{
  "key": "ssl_verify",
  "devValue": "false", 
  "prodValue": "true",
  "problematicValue": "false",
  "problematicEnvironment": "dev",
  "suggestion": "Consider enabling SSL/TLS in development for environment parity and testing.",
  "risk": "High"
}
```

**Expected Result:**
- **Dev side:** `ssl_verify: false` highlighted with red squiggly underline
- **Prod side:** `ssl_verify: true` NOT highlighted (no underline)
- **Tooltip on dev side:** "DEV Issue: Consider enabling SSL/TLS in development for environment parity and testing."

## Implementation Details

The highlighting logic now:
1. Checks if current side matches `problematicEnvironment`
2. Only applies highlighting if there's a match
3. Provides contextual recommendations based on environment
4. Supports `both` environment designation for issues affecting both sides
